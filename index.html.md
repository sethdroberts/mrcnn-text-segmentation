## How to use

Step 1: Set up and activate venv

``` python
# python -m venv venv/
# source venv/bin/activate
```

Step 2: Install requirements

``` python
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 3: Install nbdev hooks

``` python
# nbdev_install_hooks
```

Step 4: Install Jupyter kernel for venv

``` python
# ipython kernel install --user --name=venv
```

Step 5: Switch kernel for notebook to “venv”

Do all coding in 00.core module until I figure out how to use multiple
modules. ALWAYS use branches for everything. If I install any large
files (100MB or more) outside of packages, do the following:

Install Homebrew (follow instructions):

``` python
# /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Install git lfs

``` python
# brew install git-lfs
# git lfs install
# git lfs track "*.[extension]"
```

If already committed files, will need to migrate. Make sure to only
migrate the specific file. LFS will mess up Jupyter notebooks, etc.

Before committing:

``` python
# nbdev_prepare - for setting up nbdev
# pip freeze > requirements.txt - for adding any new requirements from venv
```
